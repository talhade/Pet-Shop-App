# Pet Shop App

**Pet Shop App** is a mobile application built using Flutter that features a user interface for browsing pet products. The app includes a search button for animals on the home screen, a list of animals by category, and a list of popular products. Although the product detail page exists, it is currently a static UI with no functional elements.

## Features

- **Animal Search**: A search button on the home screen to find specific animals.
- **Animal Categories**: Displays a list of animals organized by category.
- **Popular Products**: Showcases a list of popular pet products.
- **Product Detail Page**: Provides a UI for product details, but it is not functional.

## Design
